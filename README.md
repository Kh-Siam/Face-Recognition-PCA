# Face Recognition using PCA

A very simple code following the Principle Component Analysis algorithm. Both the training and testing dataset are located in the directory called "archive".

You can download the "archive" directory from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kasikrit/att-database-of-faces/data).

I use the KNN classifier on the testing dataset.
